We propose **InfiniteTalk**​​, a novel sparse-frame video dubbing framework. Given an input video and audio track, InfiniteTalk synthesizes a new video with ​​accurate lip synchronization​​ while ​​simultaneously aligning head movements, body posture, and facial expressions​​ with the audio. Unlike traditional dubbing methods that focus solely on lips, InfiniteTalk enables ​​infinite-length video generation​​ with accurate lip synchronization and consistent identity preservation. Beside, InfiniteTalk can also be used as an image-audio-to-video model with an image and an audio as input. 
- 💬 ​​Sparse-frame Video Dubbing​​ – Synchronizes not only lips, but aslo head, body, and expressions
- ⏱️ ​​Infinite-Length Generation​​ – Supports unlimited video duration
- ✨ ​​Stability​​ – Reduces hand/body distortions compared to MultiTalk
- 🚀 ​​Lip Accuracy​​ – Achieves superior lip synchronization to MultiTalk

This repository hosts the model weights for **InfiniteTalk**. For installation, usage instructions, and further documentation, please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MeiGen-AI/InfiniteTalk).
